# comp370-automata-from-regex

Python program that takes a regular expression and converts it into an equivalent non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) machine by parsing it into a syntax tree. Then, using knowledge of languages, the program converts the NFA into an equivalent deterministic finite automaton (DFA) machine. A DFA determines whether the specified input is valid and outputs yes or no accordingly.
